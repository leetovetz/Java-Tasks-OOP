# Java-Tasks-OOP
The course will cover Java fundamentals such as Java Core, collections, multithreading,<br>
OOP, design patterns,basic algorithms and data structures.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task001" >Task 001</a> -> Describe the "Cat" class. Provide it with properties and methods. Create several instances of objects of this class. Use these objects;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task002" >Task 002</a> -> Describe the "Triangle" class. Take the lengths of the sides of the triangle as properties. Implement a method that will return the area of the triangle. Create several objects of this class and test them;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task003" >Task 003</a> -> Describe the Phone class. Also describe the Network class (mobile operator's network). The phone must have a method of registration in the mobile operator's network. Also the phone must have a call method (number of another phone), which will search all the phone numbers registered in the network. If such a number is found, then make a call, if not - display a message that the dialed number is wrong;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task004" >Task 004</a> -> *Create an abstract Shape class that has two abstract methods getPerimetr() and double getArea().<br>
*Create a Point class that has two properties double x double y.<br>
*Create classes that describe at least 3 geometric shapes (they must be subclasses of Shape), and they must contain Point classes as properties.<br>
*Create a board class. The board is divided into 4 parts and each part may contain a shape. The board must have methods that place and remove a piece from the board. There should also be a method that outputs information about all the pieces on the board and their total area.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task005" >Task 005</a> -> *Create a class describing a person (create a method that outputs information about the person).<br>
*Create a class describing a person (create a method that outputs information about the person).<br>
*Create a class for a group - which contains an array of 10 objects of the student class.<br> 
*Implement methods of adding, deleting students and method of finding a student by surname. If you try to add 11 students, create your own exception and handle it.<br> 
*Define the toString() method for the group so that it outputs a list of students in alphabetical order.<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task006" >Task 006</a> -> *Improve the Group class by adding the ability to interactively add an object.<br>
*Implement the ability to sort the list of students by last name.<br>
*Implement the ability to sort by parameter (last name, grade, etc.).<br>
*Realize the Military Commissary interface which will return an array of students who are over 18 years old from a group;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task007" >Task 007</a> ->  *Write a program that copies files (with a predefined extension - for example only doc) from the source directory to the destination directory.<br>
*Write a program that takes two text files and returns one. The contents of this file must be the words that are in both the first and the second file.<br>
*Improve the class that describes a group of students by adding the ability to save the group to a file.<br>
*Implement the reverse process, i.e. read the group data from the file and use it to create an object of the group type.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task008" >Task 008</a> -> Create a hundred threads that will calculate the factorial of a number equal to the number of that thread and display the result on the screen.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task009" >Task 009</a> -> Write code for multi-threaded calculation of the sum of elements of an array of integers. Compare counting speed with simple algorithm.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task010" >Task 010</a> -> Using standard serialization methods, create a mini database for working with groups of students (the ability to write and read the database from a file on request).;<br>

## 
<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task011" >Task 011</a> -> Create a container class - stack (a class into which you can add and remove objects from other classes, only to the top of the stack) where you can store objects of any type. There must be a method to add an element to the stack, get with removing an element from the stack, and just get an element from the vertex from the stack.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task012" >Task 012</a> -> Write a method that creates a list, puts 10 items in it, then removes the first two and the last one, and then displays the result.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task013" >Task 013</a> -> Read the English text from the file, calculate the relative frequency of each letter, and display the result in descending order of relative frequency of repetition.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task014" >Task 014</a> -> Sheldon, Leonard, Wolowitz, Koothrappalli, and Penny stand in line for a "double Coke. As soon as a person drinks such a Coke, he splits and both of them go to the end of the queue to have another drink. Write a program that will display the state of the queue depending on how many glasses of cola the machine has given out with the wonderful drink.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task015" >Task 015</a> -> Write a translator program that will translate the text in the file English.in, written in English, into Ukrainian according to the previously made dictionary. The result will be saved in the file Ukranian.out.;<br>

<a href="https://github.com/LeeTovetz/Java-Tasks-OOP/tree/main/src/com/task016" >Task 016</a> -> Make a function for manually filling the dictionary and saving it to disk.;<br>
